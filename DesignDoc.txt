1. Explain why adding and removing liquidity to your exchange does not change the exchange rate.


The proportion between the quantities of asset A and asset B that can be added or removed must respect the current exchange rate.
Hence, the overall ratio between between the liquidity of the two assets after the operation remain the same as before. 
Since the exchange rate is calculated based on the liquidity of the two assets, it also does not change.


2. Explain your scheme for rewarding liquidity providers and justify the design decisions you made. How does it satisfy the liquidity rewards requirements outlined in Section 7?

During swapping, if x is the amount of asset that should be sent to the user based on the current exchange rate,
the contract will only send (1 - p) * x, where p is the fee percentage. This way, the transaction fee is automatically kept in the liqudity pools of the exchange.
As a result, when users remove liquidity in the future, they will be able to withdraw their share of transaction
fee because those transaction fees are included the pools.

3. Describe at least one method you used to minimize your exchange contract's gas usage. Why was this method effective?

In addLiquidity and removeLiquidity, I made sure only to loop through all the liquidity providers once
and finish all the operations that are needed in that one for-loop. For example, in that one for-loop of addLiquidity,
I made sure to both update every liquidity provider's share as well as keep track of whether the msg.sender
is a new provider. In the for-loop of removeLiquidity, I update every liquidity provider's share and also keep
track of the index of msg.sender in the lp list in case I need to removeLP later on.

I know that looping is very expensive, and therefore I made sure I only looped once in my functions.
